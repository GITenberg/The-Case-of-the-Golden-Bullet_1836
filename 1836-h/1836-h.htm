    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION TO JOE MULLER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Joseph Muller, Secret Service detective of the Imperial Austrian police,
      is one of the great experts in his profession. In personality he differs
      greatly from other famous detectives. He has neither the impressive
      authority of Sherlock Holmes, nor the keen brilliancy of Monsieur Lecoq.
      Muller is a small, slight, plain-looking man, of indefinite age, and of
      much humbleness of mien. A naturally retiring, modest disposition, and two
      external causes are the reasons for Muller&rsquo;s humbleness of manner, which
      is his chief characteristic. One cause is the fact that in early youth a
      miscarriage of justice gave him several years in prison, an experience
      which cast a stigma on his name and which made it impossible for him, for
      many years after, to obtain honest employment. But the world is richer,
      and safer, by Muller&rsquo;s early misfortune. For it was this experience which
      threw him back on his own peculiar talents for a livelihood, and drove him
      into the police force. Had he been able to enter any other profession, his
      genius might have been stunted to a mere pastime, instead of being, as
      now, utilised for the public good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the red tape and bureaucratic etiquette which attaches to every
      governmental department, puts the secret service men of the Imperial
      police on a par with the lower ranks of the subordinates. Muller&rsquo;s
      official rank is scarcely much higher than that of a policeman, although
      kings and councillors consult him and the Police Department realises to
      the full what a treasure it has in him. But official red tape, and his
      early misfortune... prevent the giving of any higher official standing to
      even such a genius. Born and bred to such conditions, Muller understands
      them, and his natural modesty of disposition asks for no outward honours,
      asks for nothing but an income sufficient for his simple needs, and for
      aid and opportunity to occupy himself in the way he most enjoys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Muller&rsquo;s character is a strange mixture. The kindest-hearted man in
      the world, he is a human bloodhound when once the lure of the trail has
      caught him. He scarcely eats or sleeps when the chase is on, he does not
      seem to know human weakness nor fatigue, in spite of his frail body. Once
      put on a case his mind delves and delves until it finds a clue, then
      something awakes within him, a spirit akin to that which holds the
      bloodhound nose to trail, and he will accomplish the apparently
      impossible, he will track down his victim when the entire machinery of a
      great police department seems helpless to discover anything. The high
      chiefs and commissioners grant a condescending permission when Muller
      asks, &ldquo;May I do this? ... or may I handle this case this way?&rdquo; both
      parties knowing all the while that it is a farce, and that the department
      waits helpless until this humble little man saves its honour by solving
      some problem before which its intricate machinery has stood dazed and
      puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      This call of the trail is something that is stronger than anything else in
      Muller&rsquo;s mentality, and now and then it brings him into conflict with the
      department,... or with his own better nature. Sometimes his unerring
      instinct discovers secrets in high places, secrets which the Police
      Department is bidden to hush up and leave untouched. Muller is then taken
      off the case, and left idle for a while if he persists in his opinion as
      to the true facts. And at other times, Muller&rsquo;s own warm heart gets him
      into trouble. He will track down his victim, driven by the power in his
      soul which is stronger than all volition; but when he has this victim in
      the net, he will sometimes discover him to be a much finer, better man
      than the other individual, whose wrong at this particular criminal&rsquo;s hand
      set in motion the machinery of justice. Several times that has happened to
      Muller, and each time his heart got the better of his professional
      instincts, of his practical common-sense, too, perhaps,... at least as far
      as his own advancement was concerned, and he warned the victim, defeating
      his own work. This peculiarity of Muller&rsquo;s character caused his undoing at
      last, his official undoing that is, and compelled his retirement from the
      force. But his advice is often sought unofficially by the Department, and
      to those who know, Muller&rsquo;s hand can be seen in the unravelling of many a
      famous case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following stories are but a few of the many interesting cases that
      have come within the experience of this great detective. But they give a
      fair portrayal of Muller&rsquo;s peculiar method of working, his looking on
      himself as merely an humble member of the Department, and the comedy of
      his acting under &ldquo;official orders&rdquo; when the Department is in reality
      following out his directions.

    <h2>
      THE CASE OF THE GOLDEN BULLET
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, there is a man outside who asks to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he want?&rdquo; asked Commissioner Horn, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he has something to report, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send him in, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The attendant disappeared, and the commissioner looked up at the clock. It
      was just striking eleven, but the fellow official who was to relieve him
      at that hour had not yet appeared. And if this should chance to be a new
      case, he would probably be obliged to take it himself. The commissioner
      was not in a very good humour as he sat back to receive the young man who
      entered the room in the wake of the attendant. The stranger was a sturdy
      youth, with an unintelligent, good-natured face. He twisted his soft hat
      in his hands in evident embarrassment, and his eyes wandered helplessly
      about the great bare room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded the commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Dummel, sir, Johann Dummel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your occupation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My occupation? Oh, yes, I&mdash;I am a valet, valet to Professor
      Fellner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner sat up and looked interested. He knew Fellner personally
      and liked him. &ldquo;What have you to report to me?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to have come here, but at home&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, is anything the matter?&rdquo; insisted Horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir, I don&rsquo;t know; but the Professor&mdash;he is so still&mdash;he
      doesn&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horn sprang from his chair. &ldquo;Is he ill?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. His room is locked&mdash;he never locked it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are certain he is at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I saw him during the night&mdash;and the key is in the lock on
      the inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner had his hat in his hand when the colleague who was to
      relieve him appeared. &ldquo;Good and cold out to-day!&rdquo; was the latter&rsquo;s
      greeting. Horn answered with an ironical: &ldquo;Then I suppose you&rsquo;ll be glad
      if I relieve you of this case. But I assure you I wouldn&rsquo;t do it if it
      wasn&rsquo;t Fellner. Good-bye. Oh, and one thing more. Please send a physician
      at once to Fellner&rsquo;s house, No. 7 Field Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horn opened the door and passed on into the adjoining room, accompanied by
      Johann. The commissioner halted a moment as his eyes fell upon a little
      man who sat in the corner reading a newspaper. &ldquo;Hello, Muller; you there?
      Suppose I take you with me? You aren&rsquo;t doing anything now, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come with me, then. If this should turn out to be anything serious,
      we may need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three men entered one of the cabs waiting outside the police station.
      As they rattled through the streets, Commissioner Horn continued his
      examination of the valet. &ldquo;When did you see your master last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About eleven o&rsquo;clock last evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you speak with him then?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I looked through the keyhole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed; is that a habit of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dummel blushed deeply, but his eyes flashed, and he looked angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not, sir,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I only did it this time because I was
      anxious about the master. He&rsquo;s been so worked up and nervous the last few
      days. Last night I went to the theatre, as I always do Saturday evenings.
      When I returned, about half-past ten it was, I knocked at the door of his
      bedroom. He didn&rsquo;t answer, and I walked away softly, so as not to disturb
      him in case he&rsquo;d gone to sleep already. The hall was dark, and as I went
      through it I saw a ray of light coming from the keyhole of the Professor&rsquo;s
      study. That surprised me, because he never worked as late as that before.
      I thought it over a moment, then I crept up and looked through the
      keyhole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sat at his desk, quite quiet. So I felt easy again, and went off to
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go into the room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t dare, sir. The Professor never wanted to be disturbed when he
      was writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got up at the usual time this morning, set the breakfast table, and
      then knocked at the Professor&rsquo;s bedroom door to waken him. He didn&rsquo;t
      answer, and I thought he might want to sleep, seeing as it was Sunday, and
      he was up late last night. So I waited until ten o&rsquo;clock. Then I knocked
      again and tried the door, but it was locked. That made me uneasy, because
      he never locked his bedroom door before. I banged at the door and called
      out, but there wasn&rsquo;t a sound. Then I ran to the police station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horn was evidently as alarmed as was the young valet. But Muller&rsquo;s cheeks
      were flushed and a flash of secret joy, of pleasurable expectation,
      brightened his deep-set, grey eyes. He sat quite motionless, but every
      nerve in his body was alive and tingling. The humble-looking little man
      had become quite another and a decidedly interesting person. He laid his
      thin, nervous hand on the carriage door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not there yet,&rdquo; said the commissioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s the third house from here,&rdquo; replied Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know where everybody lives, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; smiled Horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly everybody,&rdquo; answered Muller gently, as the cab stopped before an
      attractive little villa surrounded by its own garden, as were most of the
      houses in this quiet, aristocratic part of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was two stories high, but the upper windows were closed and
      tightly curtained. This upper story was the apartment occupied by the
      owner of the house, who was now in Italy with his invalid wife. Otherwise
      the dainty little villa, built in the fashionable Nuremberg style, with
      heavy wooden doors and lozenged-paned windows, had no occupants except
      Professor Fellner and his servant. With its graceful outlines and
      well-planned garden, the dwelling had a most attractive appearance.
      Opposite it was the broad avenue known as the Promenade, and beyond this
      were open fields. To the right and to the left were similar villas in
      their gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dummel opened the door and the three men entered the house. The
      commissioner and the valet went in first, Muller following them more
      slowly. His sharp eyes glanced quickly over the coloured tiles of the
      flooring, over the white steps and the carpeted hallway beyond. Once he
      bent quickly and picked up something, then he walked on with his usual
      quiet manner, out of which every trace of excitement had now vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dull winter sun seemed only to make the gloom of the dark vestibule
      more visible. Johann turned up the light, and Horn, who had visited the
      Professor several times and knew the situation of the rooms, went at once
      to the heavy, carved and iron trimmed door of the study. He attempted to
      open the door, but it resisted all pressure. The heavy key was in the
      inner side of the big lock with its medieval iron ornamentation. But the
      key was turned so that the lower part of the lock was free, a round
      opening of unusual size. Horn made sure of this by holding a lighted match
      to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said to the valet, &ldquo;the door is locked from the
      inside. We&rsquo;ll have to go through the bedroom. Johann, bring me a chisel or
      a hatchet. Muller, you stay here and open the door when the doctor comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller nodded. Johann disappeared, returning in a few moments with a small
      hatchet, and followed the commissioner through the dining-room. It was an
      attractive apartment with its high wooden panelling and its dainty
      breakfast table. But a slight shiver ran through the commissioner&rsquo;s frame
      as he realised that some misfortune, some crime even might be waiting for
      them on the other side of the closed door. The bedroom door also was
      locked on the inside, and after some moments of knocking and calling, Horn
      set the hatchet to the framework just as the bell of the house-door pealed
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cracking and tearing of wood the bedroom door fell open, and in the
      same moment Muller and the physician passed through the dining-room.
      Johann hurried into the bedroom to open the window-shutters, and the
      others gathered in the doorway. A single look showed each of the men that
      the bed was untouched, and they passed on through the room. The door from
      the bedroom to the study stood open. In the latter room the shutters were
      tightly closed, and the lamp had long since gone out. But sufficient light
      fell through the open bedroom door for the men to see the figure of the
      Professor seated at his desk, and when Johann had opened the shutters, it
      was plain to all that the silent figure before them was that of a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heart disease, probably,&rdquo; murmured the physician, as he touched the icy
      forehead. Then he felt the pulse of the stiffened hand from which the pen
      had fallen in the moment of death, raised the drooping head and lifted up
      the half-closed eyelids. The eyes were glazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others looked on in silence. Horn was very pale, and his usually calm
      face showed great emotion. Johann seemed quite beside himself, the tears
      rolled down his cheeks unhindered. Muller stood without a sign of life,
      his sallow face seemed made of bronze; he was watching and listening. He
      seemed to hear and see what no one else could see or hear. He smiled
      slightly when the doctor spoke of &ldquo;heart disease,&rdquo; and his eyes fell on
      the revolver that lay near the dead man&rsquo;s hand on the desk. Then he shook
      his head, and then he started suddenly. Horn noticed the movement; it was
      in the moment when the physician raised up the sunken figure that had
      fallen half over the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was killed by a bullet,&rdquo; said Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was it,&rdquo; replied the doctor. With the raising of the body the
      dead man&rsquo;s waistcoat fell back into its usual position, and they could see
      a little round hole in his shirt. The doctor opened the shirt bosom and
      pointed to a little wound in the Professor&rsquo;s left breast. There were
      scarcely three or four drops of blood visible. The hemorrhage had been
      internal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have died at once, without suffering,&rdquo; said the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He killed himself&mdash;he killed himself,&rdquo; murmured Johann, as if
      bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange that he should have found time to lay down the revolver
      before he died,&rdquo; remarked Horn. Johann put out his hand and raised the
      weapon before Horn could prevent him. &ldquo;Leave that pistol where it was,&rdquo;
       commanded the commissioner. &ldquo;We have to look into this matter more
      closely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor turned quickly. &ldquo;You think it was a murder?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The
      doors were both locked on the inside&mdash;where could the murderer be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to see him myself yet. But our rule is to leave things as
      they are discovered, until the official examination. Muller, did you shut
      the outer door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; here is the key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johann, are there any more keys for the outer door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. One more, that is, for the third was lost some months ago. The
      Professor&rsquo;s own key ought to be in the drawer of the little table beside
      the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please look for it, Muller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller went into the bedroom and soon returned with the key, which he
      handed to the commissioner. The detective had found something else in the
      little table drawer&mdash;a tortoise-shell hairpin, which he had carefully
      hidden in his own pocket before rejoining the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horn turned to the servant again. &ldquo;How many times have you been out of the
      apartment since last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once only, sir, to go to the police station to fetch you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you locked the door behind you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, sir. You saw that I had to turn the key twice to let you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horn and Muller both looked the young man over very carefully. He seemed
      perfectly innocent, and their suspicion that he might have turned the key
      in pretense only, soon vanished. It would have been a foolish suspicion
      anyway. If he were in league with the murderer, he could have let the
      latter escape with much more safety during the night. Horn let his eyes
      wander about the rooms again, and said slowly: &ldquo;Then the murderer is still
      here&mdash;or else&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or else?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or else we have a strange riddle to solve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johann had laid the pistol down again. Muller stretched forth his hand and
      took it up. He looked at it a moment, then handed it to the commissioner.
      &ldquo;We have to do with a murder here. There was not a shot fired from this
      revolver, for every chamber is still loaded. And there is no other weapon
      in sight,&rdquo; said the detective quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was murdered. This revolver is fully loaded. Let us begin the
      search at once.&rdquo; Horn was more excited than he cared to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johann looked about in alarm, but when he saw the others beginning to peer
      into every corner and every cupboard, he himself joined in the man-hunt. A
      quarter of an hour later, the four men relinquished their fruitless
      efforts and gathered beside the corpse again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, will you have the kindness to report to the head Commissioner of
      Police, and to order the taking away of the body? We will look about for
      some motive for this murder in the meantime,&rdquo; said Horn, as he held out
      his hand to the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller walked out to the door of the house with the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think this valet did it?&rdquo; asked the physician softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He? Oh, dear, no,&rdquo; replied the detective scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he&rsquo;s too stupid? But this stupidity might be feigned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s real enough, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you think about it&mdash;you, who have the gift of seeing
      more than other people see, even if it does bring you into disfavour with
      the Powers that Be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t believe me yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean about the beautiful Mrs. Kniepp?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I tell you I am right. It was an intentional suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muller, Muller, you must keep better watch over your imagination and your
      tongue! It is a dangerous thing to spread rumours about persons high in
      favor with the Arch-duke. But you had better tell me what you think about
      this affair,&rdquo; continued the doctor, pointing back towards the room they
      had just left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman in the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! you are romancing again. Well, they won&rsquo;t be so sensitive about this
      matter, but take care that you don&rsquo;t make a mistake again, my dear Muller.
      It would be likely to cost you your position, don&rsquo;t forget that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor left the house. Muller smiled bitterly as he closed the door
      behind him, and murmured to himself: &ldquo;Indeed, I do not forget it, and that
      is why I shall take this matter into my own hands. But the Kniepp case is
      not closed yet, by any means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to the study he saw Johann sitting quietly in a corner,
      shaking his head, as if trying to understand it all. Horn was bending over
      a sheet of writing paper which lay before the dead man. Fellner must have
      been busy at his desk when the bullet penetrated his heart. His hand in
      dying had let fall the pen, which had drawn a long black mark across the
      bottom of the sheet. One page of the paper was covered with a small,
      delicate handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horn called up the detective, and together they read the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Friend:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He challenged me&mdash;pistols&mdash;it means life or death. My enemy is
      very bitter. But I am not ready to die yet. And as I know that I would be
      the one to fall, I have refused the duel. That will help me little, for
      his revenge will know how to find me. I dare not be a moment without a
      weapon now&mdash;his threats on my refusal let me fear the worst. I have
      an uncanny presentiment of evil. I shall leave here to-morrow. With the
      excuse of having some pressing family affair to attend to, I have secured
      several days&rsquo; leave. Of course I do not intend to return. I am hoping that
      you will come here and break up my establishment in my stead. I will tell
      you everything else when I see you. I am in a hurry now, for there is a
      good deal of packing to do. If anything should happen to me, you will know
      who it is who is responsible for my death. His name is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the letter came to an abrupt close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller and Horn looked at each other in silence, then they turned their
      eyes again toward the dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a coward,&rdquo; said the detective coldly, and turned away. Horn
      repeated mechanically, &ldquo;A coward!&rdquo; and his eyes also looked down with a
      changed expression upon the handsome, soft-featured face, framed in curly
      blond hair, that lay so silent against the chair-back. Many women had
      loved this dead man, and many men had been fond of him, for they had
      believed him capable and manly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioner and Muller continued their researches in silence and with
      less interest than before. They found a heap of loose ashes in the bedroom
      stove. Letters and other trifles had been burned there. Muller raked out
      the heap very carefully, but the writing on the few pieces of paper still
      left whole was quite illegible. There were several envelopes in the
      waste-basket, but all of them were dated several months back. There was
      nothing that could give the slightest clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter written by the murdered man was sufficient proof that his death
      had been an act of vengeance. But who was it who had carried out this
      secret, terrible deed? The victim had not been allowed the time to write
      down the name of his murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horn took the letter into his keeping. Then he left the room, followed by
      Muller and the valet, to look about the rest of the house as far as
      possible. This was not very far, for the second story was closed off by a
      tall iron grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the house door locked during the daytime?&rdquo; asked Horn of the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The front door is, but the side door into the garden is usually open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it ever happened that any one got into the house from this side door
      without your knowing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. The garden has a high wall around it. And there is extra
      protection on the side toward the Promenade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a little gate there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that usually closed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never use the key for that, sir. It has a trick lock that you can&rsquo;t
      open unless you know how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you went to the theatre yesterday evening. Did your master give
      you permission to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. It&rsquo;s about a year now that he gave me money for a theatre
      ticket every Saturday evening. He was very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come into the house last night by the front door, or through the
      garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through the garden, sir. I walked down the Promenade from the theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t notice anything&mdash;you saw no traces of footsteps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I didn&rsquo;t notice anything unusual. We shut the side door, the
      garden door, every evening, also. It was closed yesterday and I found the
      key&mdash;we&rsquo;ve only got one key to the garden door&mdash;in the same
      place where I was told to hide it when I went out in the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What place was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one of the pails by the well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you were told to hide it there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; the Professor told me. He&rsquo;d go out in the evening sometimes,
      too, I suppose, and he wanted to be able to come in that way if
      necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no one else knew where the key was hidden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one else, sir. It&rsquo;s nearly a year now that we&rsquo;ve been alone in the
      house. Who else should know of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you looked through the keyhole last night, are you sure that the
      Professor was still alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, sir; of course I couldn&rsquo;t say so surely. I thought he was
      reading or writing, but oh, dear Lord! there he was this morning, nearly
      twelve hours later, in just the same position.&rdquo; Johann shivered at the
      thought that he might have seen his master sitting at his desk, already a
      corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have been dead when you came home. Don&rsquo;t you think the sound of
      that shot would have wakened you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I think likely, sir,&rdquo; murmured Johann. &ldquo;But if the murderer
      could get into the house, how could he get into the apartment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must have been a third key of which you knew nothing,&rdquo; answered
      Horn, turning to Muller again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s stranger still how Fellner could have
      been shot, for the window-shutters were fastened and quite uninjured, and
      both doors were locked on the inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words, Horn looked sharply at his subordinate; but
      Muller&rsquo;s calm face did not give the slightest clue to his thoughts. The
      experienced police commissioner was pleased and yet slightly angered at
      this behaviour on the part of the detective. He knew that it was quite
      possible that Muller had already formed a clear opinion about the case,
      and that he was merely keeping it to himself. And yet he was glad to see
      that the little detective had apparently learned a lesson from his recent
      mistake concerning the death of Mrs. Kniepp&mdash;that he had somewhat
      lost confidence in his hitherto unerring instinct, and did not care to
      express any opinion until he had studied the matter a little closer. The
      commissioner was just a little bit vain, and just a little bit jealous of
      this humble detective&rsquo;s fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller shrugged his shoulders at the remark of his superior, and the two
      men stood silent, thinking over the case, as the Chief of Police appeared,
      accompanied by the doctor, a clerk, and two hospital attendants. The chief
      commissioner received the report of what had been discovered, while the
      corpse was laid on a bier to be taken to the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller handed the commissioner his hat and cane and helped him into his
      overcoat. Horn noticed that the detective himself was making no
      preparations to go out. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming with us?&rdquo; he asked, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the gentlemen will allow me to remain here for a little while,&rdquo;
       answered Muller modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know that we will have to close the apartment officially,&rdquo; said
      Horn, his voice sharpening in his surprise and displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not need to be in these rooms any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them disturb you, my dear Muller; we will allow your keenness
      all possible leeway here.&rdquo; The Head of Police spoke with calm politeness,
      but Muller started and shivered. The emphasis on the &ldquo;here&rdquo; showed him
      that even the head of the department had been incensed at his suggestion
      that the beautiful Mrs. Kniepp had died of her own free will. It had been
      his assertion of this which, coming to the ears of the bereaved husband,
      had enraged and embittered him, and had turned the power of his influence
      with the high authorities against the detective. Muller knew how greatly
      he had fallen from favour in the Police Department, and the words of his
      respected superior showed him that he was still in disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the strange, quiet smile was still on his lips as, with his usual
      humble deference, he accompanied the others to the sidewalk. Before the
      commissioners left the house, the Chief commanded Johann to answer
      carefully any questions Muller might put to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll find something, you may be sure,&rdquo; said Horn, as they drove off in
      the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him that&rsquo;s his business. He is officially bound to see more than the
      rest of us,&rdquo; smiled the older official good-naturedly. &ldquo;But in spite of
      it, he&rsquo;ll never get any further than the vestibule; he&rsquo;ll be making bows
      to us to the end of his days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so? I&rsquo;ve wondered at the man. I know his fame in the capital,
      indeed, in police circles all over Austria and Germany. It seems hard on
      him to be transferred to this small town, now that he is growing old. I&rsquo;ve
      wondered why he hasn&rsquo;t done more for himself, with his gifts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never will,&rdquo; replied the Chief. &ldquo;He may win more fame&mdash;he may
      still go on winning triumphs, but he will go on in a circle; he&rsquo;ll never
      forge ahead as his capabilities deserve. Muller&rsquo;s peculiarity is that his
      genius&mdash;for the man has undeniable genius&mdash;will always make
      concessions to his heart just at the moment when he is about to do
      something great&mdash;and his triumph is lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horn looked up at his superior, whom, in spite of his good nature, he knew
      to be a sharp, keen, capable police official. &ldquo;I forgot you have known
      Muller longer than the rest of us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What was that you said about
      his heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that it is one of those inconvenient hearts that will always make
      itself noticeable at the wrong time. Muller&rsquo;s heart has played several
      tricks on the police department, which has, at other times, profited so
      well by his genius. He is a strange mixture. While he is on the trail of
      the criminal he is like the bloodhound. He does not seem to know fatigue
      nor hunger; his whole being is absorbed by the excitement of the chase. He
      has done many a brilliant service to the cause of justice, he has
      discovered the guilt, or the innocence, of many in cases where the
      official department was as blind as Justice is proverbially supposed to
      be. Joseph Muller has become the idol of all who are engaged in this weary
      business of hunting down wrong and punishing crime. He is without a peer
      in his profession. But he has also become the idol of some of the
      criminals. For if he discovers (as sometimes happens) that the criminal is
      a good sort after all, he is just as likely to warn his prey, once he has
      all proofs of the guilt and a conviction is certain. Possibly this is his
      way of taking the sting from his irresistible impulse to ferret out hidden
      mysteries. But it is rather inconvenient, and he has hurt himself by it&mdash;hurt
      himself badly. They were tired of his peculiarities at the capital, and
      wanted to make his years an excuse to discharge him. I happened to get
      wind of it, and it was my weakness for him that saved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you brought him here when they transferred you to this town, I
      remember now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it wasn&rsquo;t such a good thing for him, after all. Nothing ever
      happens here, and a gift like Muller&rsquo;s needs occupation to keep it fresh.
      I&rsquo;m afraid his talents will dull and wither here. The man has grown
      perceptibly older in this inaction. His mind is like a high-bred horse
      that needs exercise to keep it in good condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t grown rich at his work, either,&rdquo; said Horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s not much chance for a police detective to get rich. I&rsquo;ve
      often wondered why Muller never had the energy to set up in business for
      himself. He might have won fame and fortune as a private detective. But
      he&rsquo;s gone on plodding along as a police subordinate, and letting the
      department get all the credit for his most brilliant achievements. It&rsquo;s a
      sort of incorrigible humbleness of nature&mdash;and then, you know, he had
      the misfortune to be unjustly sentenced to a term in prison in his early
      youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did not know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stigma stuck to his name, and finally drove him to take up this work.
      I don&rsquo;t think Muller realised, when he began, just how greatly he is
      gifted. I don&rsquo;t know that he really knows now. He seems to do it because
      he likes it&mdash;he&rsquo;s a queer sort of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the commissioners drove through the streets to the police station
      the man of whom they were speaking sat in Johann&rsquo;s little room in close
      consultation with the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is it since the Professor began to give you money to go to the
      theatre on Saturday evenings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first time it happened was on my name day.&rdquo;
 </p>
    <p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the rest of your
      name? There are so many Johanns on the calendar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Johann Nepomuk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller took a little calendar from his pocket and turned its pages. &ldquo;It
      was May sixteenth,&rdquo; volunteered the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. May sixteenth was a Saturday. And since then you have gone
      to the theatre every Saturday evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did the owner of the house go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last April. His wife was ill and he had to take her away. They went to
      Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you two have been alone in the house since April?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, we two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there no janitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. The garden was taken care of by a man who came in for the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you had no dog? I haven&rsquo;t seen any around the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; the Professor did not like animals. But he must have been
      thinking about buying a dog, because I found a new dog-whip in his room
      one day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody might have left it there. One usually buys the dog first and
      then the whip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. But there wasn&rsquo;t anybody here to forget it. The Professor did
      not receive any visits at that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it was the middle of summer, and everybody was away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, we won&rsquo;t bother about the whip. Can you tell me of any ladies
      with whom the Professor was acquainted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies? I don&rsquo;t know of any. Of course, the Professor was invited out a
      good deal, and most of the other gentlemen from the college were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he ever receive letters from ladies?&rdquo; continued Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johann thought the matter over, then confessed that he knew very little
      about writing and couldn&rsquo;t read handwriting very well anyway. But he
      remembered to have seen a letter now and then, a little letter with a fine
      and delicate handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any of these envelopes?&rdquo; asked Muller. But Johann told him that
      in spite of his usual carelessness in such matters, Professor Fellner
      never allowed these letters to lie about his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the detective came out with the question to which he had been
      leading up. &ldquo;Did your master ever receive visits from ladies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johann looked extremely stupid at this moment. His lack of intelligence
      and a certain crude sensitiveness in his nature made him take umbrage at
      what appeared to him a very unnecessary question. He answered it with a
      shake of the head only. Muller smiled at the young man&rsquo;s ill-concealed
      indignation and paid no attention to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your master has been here for about a year. Where was he before that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were in his service then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been with him for three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he know any ladies in his former home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one&mdash;I think he was engaged to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie. That&rsquo;s all I know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw her. The only way I knew about her was when the Professor&rsquo;s
      friends spoke of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he have many friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were ever so many gentlemen whom he called his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me into the garden now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Muller took his hat and coat and followed the valet into the
      garden. It was of considerable size, carefully and attractively planned,
      and pleasing even now when the bare twigs bent under their load of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now think carefully, Johann. We had a full moon last night. Don&rsquo;t you
      remember seeing any footsteps in the garden, leading away from the house?&rdquo;
       asked Muller, as they stood on the snow-covered paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johann thought it over carefully, then said decidedly, &ldquo;No. At least I
      don&rsquo;t remember anything of the kind. There was a strong wind yesterday
      anyway, and the snow drifts easily out here. No tracks could remain clear
      for long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men walked down the straight path which led to the little gate in the
      high wall. This gate had a secret lock, which, however, was neither hard
      to find nor hard to open. Muller managed it with ease, and looked out
      through the gate on the street beyond. The broad promenade, deserted now
      in its winter snowiness, led away in one direction to the heart of the
      city. In the other it ended in the main county high-road. This was a
      broad, well-made turnpike, with footpath and rows of trees. A half-hour&rsquo;s
      walk along it would bring one to the little village clustering about the
      Archduke&rsquo;s favourite hunting castle. There was a little railway station
      near the castle, but it was used only by suburban trains or for the royal
      private car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller did not intend to burden his brain with unnecessary facts, so with
      his usual thoroughness he left the further investigation of what lay
      beyond the gate, until he had searched the garden thoroughly. But even for
      his sharp eyes there was no trace to be found that would tell of the night
      visit of the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In which of the pails did you put the key to the side door?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first pail on the right hand side. But be careful, sir; there&rsquo;s a
      nail sticking out of the post there. The wind tore off a piece of wood
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warning came too late. Muller&rsquo;s sleeve tore apart with a sharp sound
      just as Johann spoke, for the detective had already plunged his hand into
      the pail. The bottom of the bucket was easy to reach, as this one hung
      much lower than the others. Looking regretfully at the rent in his coat,
      Muller asked for needle and thread that he might repair it sufficiently to
      get home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother about sewing it; I&rsquo;ll lend you one of mine,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Johann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry this one home for you, for I&rsquo;m not going to stay here
      alone&mdash;I&rsquo;d be afraid. I&rsquo;m going to a friend&rsquo;s house. You can find me
      there any time you need me. You&rsquo;d better take the key of the apartment and
      give it to the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective had no particular fondness for the task of sewing, and he
      was glad to accept the valet&rsquo;s friendly offering. He was rather astonished
      at the evident costliness of the garment the young man handed him, and
      when he spoke of it, the valet could not say enough in praise of the
      kindness of his late master. He pulled out several other articles of
      clothing, which, like the overcoat, had been given to him by Fellner. Then
      he packed up a few necessities and announced himself as ready to start. He
      insisted on carrying the torn coat, and Muller permitted it after some
      protest. They carefully closed the apartment and the house, and walked
      toward the centre of the city to the police station, where Muller lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they crossed the square, it suddenly occurred to Johann that he had no
      tobacco. He was a great smoker, and as he had many days of enforced
      idleness ahead of him, he ran into a tobacco shop to purchase a
      sufficiency of this necessity of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller waited outside, and his attention was attracted by a large grey
      Ulmer hound which was evidently waiting for some one within the shop. The
      dog came up to him in a most friendly manner, allowed him to pat its head,
      rubbed up against him with every sign of pleasure, and would not leave him
      even when he turned to go after Johann came out of the shop. Still
      accompanied by the dog, the two men walked on quite a distance, when a
      sharp whistle was heard behind them, and the dog became uneasy. He would
      not leave them, however, until a powerful voice called &ldquo;Tristan!&rdquo; several
      times. Muller turned and saw that Tristan&rsquo;s master was a tall, stately man
      wearing a handsome fur overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to recognise his face at this distance, for the
      snowflakes were whirling thickly in the air. But Muller was not
      particularly anxious to recognise the stranger, as he had his head full of
      more important thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Johann had given his new address and remarked that he would call for
      his coat soon, the men parted, and Muller returned to the police station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the principal newspaper of the town printed the following
      notice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      THE GOLDEN BULLET

  It is but a few days since we announced to our readers the sad
  news of the death of a beautiful woman, whose leap from her
  window, while suffering from the agonies of fever, destroyed
  the happiness of an unusually harmonious marriage.  And now we
  are compelled to print the news of another equally sad as well
  as mysterious occurrence.  This time, Fate has demanded the
  sacrifice of the life of a capable and promising young man.
  Professor Paul Fellner, a member of the faculty of our college,
  was found dead at his desk yesterday morning.  It was thought at
  first that it was a case of suicide, for doors and windows were
  carefully closed from within and those who discovered the corpse
  were obliged to break open one of the doors to get to it.  And
  a revolver was found lying close at hand, upon the desk.  But
  this revolver was loaded in every chamber and there was no other
  weapon to be seen in the room.  There was a bullet wound in the
  left breast of the corpse, and the bullet had penetrated the
  heart.  Death must have been instantaneous.

  The most mysterious thing about this strange affair was
  discovered during the autopsy.  It is incredible, but it is
  absolutely true, as it is vouched for under oath by the
  authorities who were present, that the bullet which was found
  in the heart of the dead man was made of solid gold.  And yet,
  strange as is this circumstance, it is still more a riddle how
  the murderer could have escaped from the room where he had shot
  down his victim, for the keys in both doors were in the locks
  from the inside.  We have evidently to do here with a criminal
  of very unusual cleverness and it is therefore not surprising
  that there has been no clue discovered thus far.  The only
  thing that is known is that this murder was an act of revenge.
</pre>
    <p>
      The entire city was in excitement over the mystery, even the police
      station was shaken out of its usual business-like indifference. There was
      no other topic of conversation in any of the rooms but the mystery of the
      golden bullet and the doors closed from the inside. The attendants and the
      policeman gathered whispering in the corners, and strangers who came in on
      their own business forgot it in their excitement over this new and
      fascinating mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon Muller passed through Horn&rsquo;s office with a bundle of
      papers, on his way to the inner office occupied by his patron, Chief of
      Police Bauer. Horn, who had avoided Muller since yesterday although he was
      conscious of a freshened interest in the man, raised his head and watched
      the little detective as he walked across the room with his usual quiet
      tread. The commissioner saw nothing but the usual humble business-like
      manner to which he was accustomed&mdash;then suddenly something happened
      that came to him like a distinct shock. Muller stopped in his walk so
      suddenly that one foot was poised in the air. His bowed head was thrown
      back, his face flushed to his forehead, and the papers trembled in his
      hands. He ran the fingers of his unoccupied hand through his hair and
      murmured audibly, &ldquo;That dog! that dog!&rdquo; It was evident that some thought
      had struck him with such insistence as to render him oblivious of his
      surroundings. Then he finally realised where he was, and walked on quickly
      to Bauer&rsquo;s room, his face still flushed, his hands trembling. When he came
      out from the office again, he was his usual quiet, humble self.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the commissioner, with his now greater knowledge of the little man&rsquo;s
      gifts and past, could not forget the incident. During the afternoon he
      found himself repeating mechanically, &ldquo;That dog&mdash;that dog.&rdquo; But the
      words meant nothing to him, hard as he might try to find the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the commissioner left for his home late that afternoon, Muller
      re-entered the office to lay some papers on the desk. His duties over, he
      was about to turn out the gas, when his eye fell on the blotter on Horn&rsquo;s
      desk. He looked at it more closely, then burst into a loud laugh. The same
      two words were scribbled again and again over the white surface, but it
      was not the name of any fair maiden, or even the title of a love poem; it
      was only the words, &ldquo;That dog&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several days had passed since the discovery of the murder. Fellner had
      been buried and his possessions taken into custody by the authorities
      until his heirs should appear. The dead man&rsquo;s papers and affairs were in
      excellent condition and the arranging of the inheritance had been quickly
      done. Until the heirs should take possession, the apartment was sealed by
      the police. There was nothing else to do in the matter, and the commission
      appointed to make researches had discovered nothing of value. The murderer
      might easily feel that he was absolutely safe by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the publication of the article we have quoted, Muller
      appeared in Bauer&rsquo;s office and asked for a few days&rsquo; leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Fellner case?&rdquo; asked the Chief with his usual calm, and Muller
      replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later he returned, bringing with him nothing but a single little
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie Dorn, now Mrs. Kniepp,&rdquo; was one line in his notebook, and beside it
      some dates. The latter showed that Marie Dorn had for two years past been
      the wife of the Archducal Forest-Councillor, Leo Kniepp.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for one year now Professor Paul Fellner had been in the town, after
      having applied for his transference from the university in the capital to
      this place, which was scarce half an hour&rsquo;s walk distant from the home of
      the beautiful young woman who had been the love of his youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Fellner had made his home in the quietest quarter of the city, in that
      quarter which was nearest the Archducal hunting castle. He had lived very
      quietly, had not cultivated the acquaintance of the ladies of the town,
      but was a great walker and bicycle rider; and every Saturday evening since
      he had been alone in the house, he had sent his servant to the theatre.
      And it was on Saturday evenings that Forest-Councillor Kniepp went to his
      Bowling Club at the other end of the city, and did not return until the
      last train at midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during these evening hours Fellner&rsquo;s apartment was a convenient place
      for pleasant meetings; and nothing prevented the Professor from
      accompanying his beautiful friend home through the quiet Promenade, along
      the turnpike to the hunting castle. And Johann had once found a dog-whip
      in his master&rsquo;s room-and Councillor Leo Kniepp, head of the Forestry
      Department, was the possessor of a beautiful Ulmer hound which took an
      active interest in people who wore clothes belonging to Fellner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, in the little drawer of the bedside table in the murdered
      man&rsquo;s room, there had been found a tortoise-shell hairpin; and in the
      corner of the vestibule of his house, a little mother-of-pearl glove
      button, of the kind much in fashion that winter, because of a desire on
      the part of the ladies of the town to help the home industry of the
      neighbourhood. Mrs. Marie Kniepp was one of the fashionable women of the
      town, and several days before the Professor was murdered, this woman had
      thrown herself from the second-story window of her home, and her husband,
      whose passionate eccentric nature was well known, had been a changed man
      from that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his deep grief at the loss of his beloved wife that had turned his
      hair grey and had drawn lines of terrible sorrow in his face&mdash;said
      gossip. But Muller, who did not know Kniepp personally although he had
      been taking a great interest in his affairs for the last few days, had his
      own ideas on the subject, and he decided to make the acquaintance of the
      Forest Councillor as soon as possible&mdash;that is, after he had found
      out all there was to be found out about his affairs and his habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a week after the murder, on Saturday evening therefore, the snow was
      whirling merrily about the gables and cupolas of the Archducal hunting
      castle. The weather-vanes groaned and the old trees in the park bent their
      tall tops under the mad wind which swept across the earth and tore the
      protecting snow covering from their branches. It was a stormy evening, not
      one to be out in if a man had a warm corner in which to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old peddler was trying to find shelter from the rapidly increasing
      storm under the lea of the castle wall. He crouched so close to the stones
      that he could scarcely be seen at all, in spite of the light from the
      snow. Finally he disappeared altogether behind one of the heavy columns
      which sprang out at intervals from the magnificent wall. Only his head
      peeped out occasionally as if looking for something. His dark, thoughtful
      eyes glanced over the little village spread out on one side of the castle,
      and over the railway station, its most imposing building. Then they would
      turn back again to the entrance gate in the wall near where he stood. It
      was a heavy iron-barred gate, its handsome ornamentation outlined in snow,
      and behind it the body of a large dog could be occasionally seen. This dog
      was an enormous grey Ulmer hound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peddler stood for a long time motionless behind the pillar, then he
      looked at his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly time,&rdquo; he murmured, and looked over
      towards the station again, where lights and figures were gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time the noise of an opening door was heard, and steps creaked
      over the snow. A man, evidently a servant, opened the little door beside
      the great gate and held it for another man to pass out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come back
      by the night train as usual, sir?&rdquo; he asked respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other, pushing back the dog, which fawned upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back here, Tristan,&rdquo; called the servant, pulling the dog in by his
      collar, as he closed the door and re-entered the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Councillor took the path to the station. He walked slowly, with bowed
      head and uneven step. He did not look like a man who was in the mood to
      join a merry crowd, and yet he was evidently going to his Club. &ldquo;He wants
      to show himself; he doesn&rsquo;t want to let people think that he has anything
      to be afraid of,&rdquo; murmured the peddler, looking after him sharply. Then
      his eyes suddenly dimmed and a light sigh was heard, with another murmur,
      &ldquo;Poor man.&rdquo; The Councillor reached the station and disappeared within its
      door. The train arrived and departed a few moments later. Kniepp must have
      really gone to the city, for although the man behind the pillar waited for
      some little time, the Councillor did not return&mdash;a contingency that
      the peddler had not deemed improbable.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half an hour after the departure of the train the watcher came out
      of his hiding place and walked noisily past the gate. What he expected,
      happened. The dog rushed up to the bars, barking loudly, but when the
      peddler had taken a silk muffler from the pack on his back and held it out
      to the animal, the noise ceased and the dog&rsquo;s anger turned to
      friendliness. Tristan was quite gentle, put his huge head up to the bars
      to let the stranger pat it, and seemed not at all alarmed when the latter
      rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man who had opened the door for the Councillor came out from a
      wing of the castle. The peddler looked so frozen and yet so venerable that
      the youth had not the heart to turn him away. Possibly he was glad of a
      little diversion for his own sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you want to see?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to speak to the maid, the one who attended your dead mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then you know&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of the misfortune that has happened here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think that Nanette might have something to sell to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it; that&rsquo;s why I came. For I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s much
      chance for any business with my cigar holders and other trifles here so
      near the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cigar holders? Why, I don&rsquo;t know; perhaps we can make a trade. Come in
      with me. Why, just see how gentle the dog is with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he that way with everybody? I supposed he was no watchdog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed he is. He usually won&rsquo;t allow anybody to touch him, except
      those whom he knows well. I&rsquo;m astonished that he lets you come to the
      house at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the door by this time. The peddler laid his hand on the
      servant&rsquo;s arm and halted a moment. &ldquo;Where was it that she threw herself
      out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the last window upstairs there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did it kill her at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Anyway she was unconscious when we came down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the master at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, it happened in the middle of the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had a fever, didn&rsquo;t she? Had she been ill long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She was in bed that day, but we thought it was nothing of
      importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These fevers come on quickly sometimes,&rdquo; remarked the old man wisely, and
      added: &ldquo;This case interests the entire neighbourhood and I will show you
      that I can be grateful for anything you may tell me&mdash;of course, only
      what a faithful servant could tell. It will interest my customers very
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all there is to know,&rdquo; said the valet, evidently disappointed
      that he had nothing to tell which could win the peddler&rsquo;s gratitude.
      &ldquo;There are no secrets about it. Everybody knows that they were a very
      happy couple, and even if there was a little talk between them on that
      day, why it was pure accident and had nothing to do with the mistress&rsquo; 
      excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there was a quarrel between them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are people talking about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard some things said. They even say that this quarrel was the
      reason for&mdash;her death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s stupid nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed the servant. The old peddler seemed to
      like the young man&rsquo;s honest indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were talking, they had passed through a long corridor and the
      young man laid his hand on one of the doors as the peddler asked, &ldquo;Can I
      see Miss Nanette alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone? Oho, she&rsquo;s engaged to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said the stranger, who seemed to be initiated into all the
      doings of this household. &ldquo;And I am an old man&mdash;all I meant was that
      I would rather not have any of the other servants about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep the cook out of the way if you want me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a good idea. It isn&rsquo;t easy to talk business before
      others,&rdquo; remarked the old man as they entered the room. It was a
      comfortably furnished and cozily warm apartment. Only two people were
      there, an old woman and a pretty young girl, who both looked up in
      astonishment as the men came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this you&rsquo;re bringing in, George?&rdquo; asked Nanette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a peddler and he&rsquo;s got some trifles here you might like to look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, you wanted a thimble, didn&rsquo;t you, Lena?&rdquo; asked Nanette, and the
      cook beckoned to the peddler. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what you&rsquo;ve got there,&rdquo; she said
      in a friendly tone. The old man pulled out his wares from his pack;
      thimbles and scissors, coloured ribbons, silks, brushes and combs, and
      many other trifles. When the women had made their several selections they
      noticed that the old man was shivering with the cold, as he leaned against
      the stove. Their sympathies were aroused in a moment. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit
      down?&rdquo; asked Nanette, pushing a chair towards him, and Lena rose to get
      him something warm from the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peddler threw a look at George, who nodded in answer. &ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d
      like to see the things they gave you after Mrs. Kniepp&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; the young
      man remarked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you buy things like that?&rdquo; Nanette turned to the peddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to look at them first, if you&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to get rid of them. But I won&rsquo;t go upstairs, I&rsquo;m afraid
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll get the things for you if you want me to,&rdquo; offered George and
      turned to leave the room. The door had scarcely closed behind him when a
      change came over the peddler. His old head rose from its drooping
      position, his bowed figure started up with youthful elasticity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really fond of him?&rdquo; he asked of the astonished Nanette, who
      stepped back a pace, stammering in answer: &ldquo;Yes. Why do you ask? and who
      are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that, my dear child, but just answer the questions I have to
      ask, and answer truthfully, or it might occur to me to let your George
      know that he is not the first man you have loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; she breathed in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peddler laughed. &ldquo;Oho, then he&rsquo;s jealous! All the better for me&mdash;the
      Councillor was jealous too, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Nanette looked at him in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth, therefore, you must tell me the truth, and get the others
      away, so I can speak to you alone. You must do this&mdash;or else I&rsquo;ll
      tell George about the handsome carpenter in Church street, or about Franz
      Schmid, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, stop&mdash;stop&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do anything you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl sank back on her chair pale and trembling, while the peddler
      resumed his pose of a tired old man leaning against the stove. When George
      returned with a large basket, Nanette had calmed herself sufficiently to
      go about the unpacking of the articles in the hamper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George, won&rsquo;t you please keep Lena out in the kitchen. Ask her to make
      some tea for us,&rdquo; asked Nanette with well feigned assurance. George smiled
      a meaning smile and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am particularly interested in the dead lady&rsquo;s gloves,&rdquo; said the peddler
      when they were alone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanette looked at him in surprise but was still too frightened to offer
      any remarks. She opened several boxes and packages and laid a number of
      pairs of gloves on the table. The old man looked through them, turning
      them over carefully. Then he shook his head: &ldquo;There must be some more
      somewhere,&rdquo; he said. Nanette was no longer astonished at anything he might
      say or do, so she obediently went through the basket again and found a
      little box in which were several pair of grey suede gloves, fastened by
      bluish mother-of-pearl buttons. One of the pairs had been worn, and a
      button was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the ones I was looking for,&rdquo; said the peddler, putting the
      gloves in his pocket. Then he continued: &ldquo;Your mistress was rather fond of
      taking long walks by herself, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s pale face flushed hotly and she stammered: &ldquo;You know&mdash;about
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know about it also, I see. And did you know everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, everything,&rdquo; murmured Nanette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was you and Tristan who accompanied the lady on her walks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I supposed she must have taken some one into her confidence. Well, and
      what do you think about the murder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Professor?&rdquo; replied Nanette hastily. &ldquo;Why, what should I know about
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Councillor was greatly excited and very unhappy when he discovered
      this affair, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did he act after the&mdash;let us call it the accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was like a crazy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me that he went about his duties just the same&mdash;that he
      went away on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t business this time, at least not professional business. But
      before that he did have to go away frequently for weeks at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was then that your mistress was most interested in her lonely
      walks, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Nanette&rsquo;s voice was so low as to be scarcely heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and this time?&rdquo; continued the peddler. &ldquo;Why did he go away this
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went to the capital on private business of his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure. He went two different times. I thought it was because he
      couldn&rsquo;t stand it here and wanted to see something different. He went to
      his club this evening, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when did he go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first time was the day after his wife was buried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the second time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two or three days after his return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long did he stay away the first time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Pull yourself together now. I&rsquo;ll send your George in to you and
      tell him you haven&rsquo;t been feeling well. Don&rsquo;t tell any one about our
      conversation. Where is the kitchen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last door to the right down the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peddler left the room and Nanette sank down dazed and trembling on the
      nearest chair. George found her still pale, but he seemed to think it
      quite natural that she should have been overcome by the recollection of
      the terrible death of her mistress. He gave the old man a most cordial
      invitation to return during the next few days. The cook brought the
      peddler a cup of steaming tea, and purchased several trifles from him,
      before he left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the old man had reached a lonely spot on the road, about half way
      between the hunting castle and the city, he halted, set down his pack,
      divested himself of his beard and his wig and washed the wrinkles from his
      face with a handful of snow from the wayside. A quarter of an hour later,
      Detective Muller entered the railway station of the city, burdened with a
      large grip. He took a seat in the night express which rolled out from the
      station a few moments later.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was alone in his compartment, Muller gave way to his excitement,
      sometimes even murmuring half-aloud the thoughts that rushed through his
      brain. &ldquo;Yes, I am convinced of it, but can I find the proofs?&rdquo; the words
      came again and again, and in spite of the comfortable warmth in the
      compartment, in spite of his tired and half-frozen condition, he could not
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the capital at midnight and took a room in a small hotel in a
      quiet street. When he went out next morning, the servants looked after him
      with suspicion, as in their opinion a man who spent most of the night
      pacing up and down his room must surely have a guilty conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller went to police headquarters and looked through the arrivals at the
      hotels on the 21st of November. The burial of Mrs. Kniepp had taken place
      on the 20th. Muller soon found the name he was looking for, &ldquo;Forest
      Councillor Leo Kniepp,&rdquo; in the list of guests at the Hotel Imperial. The
      detective went at once to the Hotel Imperial, where he was already well
      known. It cost him little time and trouble to discover what he wished to
      know, the reason for the Councillor&rsquo;s visit to the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kniepp had asked for the address of a goldsmith, and had been directed to
      one of the shops which had the best reputation in the city. He had been in
      the capital altogether for about twenty-four hours. He had the manner and
      appearance of a man suffering under some terrible blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller himself was deep in thought as he entered the train to return to
      his home, after a visit to the goldsmith in question. He had a short
      interview with Chief of Police Bauer, who finally gave him the golden
      bullet and the keys to the apartment of the murdered man. Then the two
      went out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, the chief of police and Muller stood in the garden of the
      house in which the murder had occurred. Bauer had entered from the
      Promenade after Muller had shown him how to work the lock of the little
      gate. Together they went up into the apartment, which was icy cold and
      uncanny in its loneliness. But the two men did not appear to notice this,
      so greatly were they interested in the task that had brought them there.
      First of all, they made a most minute examination of the two doors which
      had been locked. The keys were still in both locks on the inside. They
      were big heavy keys, suitable for the tall massive heavily-panelled and
      iron-ornamented doors. The entire villa was built in this heavy old German
      style, the favourite fashion of the last few years.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had looked the locks over carefully, Muller lit the lamp that
      hung over the desk in the study and closed the window shutters tight.
      Bauer had smiled at first as he watched his protege&rsquo;s actions, but his
      smile changed to a look of keen interest as he suddenly understood. Muller
      took his place in the chair before the desk and looked over at the door of
      the vestibule, which was directly opposite him. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo;
       he said with a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bauer had sat down on the sofa to watch the proceedings, now he sprang up
      with an exclamation: &ldquo;Through the keyhole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through the keyhole,&rdquo; answered Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is scarcely possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we try it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you do it.&rdquo; Even the usually indifferent old chief of police
      was breathing more hastily now. Muller took a roll of paper and a small
      pistol out of his pocket. He unrolled the paper, which represented the
      figure of a French soldier with a marked target on the breast. The
      detective pinned the paper on the back of the chair in which Professor
      Fellner had been seated when he met his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the key was in the hole,&rdquo; objected Bauer suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it was turned so that the lower part of the hole was free.
      Johann saw the light streaming through and could look into the room. If
      the murderer put the barrel of his pistol to this open part of the
      keyhole, the bullet would have to strike exactly where the dead man sat.
      There would be no need to take any particular aim.&rdquo; Muller gazed into
      space like a seer before whose mental eye a vision has arisen, and
      continued in level tones: &ldquo;Fellner had refused the duel and the murderer
      was crazed by his desire for revenge. He came here to the house, he must
      have known just how to enter the place, how to reach the rooms, and he
      must have known also, that the Professor, coward as he was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coward? Is a man a coward when he refuses to stand up to a maniac?&rdquo;
       interrupted Bauer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller came back to the present with a start and said calmly, &ldquo;Fellner was
      a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know more than you are telling me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; he answered with a smile. &ldquo;But I will tell you
      more only when I have all the proofs in my own hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the criminal will escape us in the meantime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has no idea that he is suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;you&rsquo;ll promise to be sensible this time, Muller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But you will pardon me my present reticence, even towards you? I&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t want to be thought a dreamer again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As in the Kniepp case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As in the Kniepp case,&rdquo; repeated the little man with a strange smile. &ldquo;So
      please allow me to go about it in my own way. I will tell you all you want
      to know to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I now continue to unfold my theories?&rdquo; Bauer nodded and Muller
      continued: &ldquo;The criminal wanted Fellner&rsquo;s blood, no matter how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if it meant murder,&rdquo; said Bauer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller nodded calmly. &ldquo;It would have been nobler, perhaps, to have warned
      his victim of his approach, but it might have all come to nothing then.
      The other could have called for help, could have barricaded himself in his
      room, one crime might have been prevented, and another, more shameful one,
      would have gone unavenged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another crime? Fellner a criminal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow you shall know everything, my kind friend. And now, let us make
      the trial. Please lock the door behind me as it was locked then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller left the room, taking the pistol with him. Bauer locked the door.
      &ldquo;Is this right?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can see a wide curve of the room, taking in the entire desk.
      Please stand to one side now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was deep silence for a moment, then a slight sound as of metal on
      metal, then a report, and Muller re-entered the study through the bedroom.
      He found Bauer stooping over the picture of the French soldier. There was
      a hole in the left breast, where the bullet, passing through, had buried
      itself in the back of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was all just as you said,&rdquo; began the chief of police, holding out
      his hand to Muller. &ldquo;But&mdash;why the golden bullet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, to-morrow,&rdquo; replied the detective, looking up at his superior
      with a glance of pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the house together and in less than an hour&rsquo;s time Muller was
      again in the train rolling towards the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the goldsmith&rsquo;s shop as soon as he arrived. The proprietor
      received him with eager interest and Muller handed him the golden bullet.
      &ldquo;Here is the golden object of which I spoke,&rdquo; said the detective, paying
      no heed to the other&rsquo;s astonishment. The goldsmith opened a small locked
      drawer, took a ring from it and set about an examination of the two little
      objects. When he turned to his visitor again, he was evidently satisfied
      with what he had discovered. &ldquo;These two objects are made of exactly the
      same sort of gold, of a peculiar old French composition, which can no
      longer be produced in the same richness. The weight of the gold in the
      bullet is exactly the same as in the ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be willing to take an oath on that if you were called in as an
      expert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing to stand up for my judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. And now will you read this over please, it contains the substance
      of what you told me yesterday. Should I have made any mistakes, please
      correct them, for I will ask you to set your signature to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller handed several sheets of close writing to the goldsmith and the
      latter read aloud as follows: &ldquo;On the 22nd of November, a gentleman came
      into my shop and handed me a wedding ring with the request that I should
      make another one exactly like it. He was particularly anxious that the
      work should be done in two days at the very latest, and also that the new
      ring, in form, colour, and in the engraving on the inside, should be a
      perfect counterpart of the first. He explained his order by saying that
      his wife was ill, and that she was grieving over the loss of her wedding
      ring which had somehow disappeared. The new ring could be found somewhere
      as if by chance and the sick woman&rsquo;s anxiety would be over. Two days
      later, as arranged, the same gentleman appeared again and I handed him the
      two rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He left the shop, greatly satisfied with my work and apparently much
      relieved in his mind. But he left me uneasy in spirit because I had
      deceived him. It had not been possible for me to reproduce exactly the
      composition of the original ring, and as I believed that the work was to
      be done in order to comfort an invalid, and I was getting no profit, but
      on the contrary a little extra work out of it, I made two new rings,
      lettered them according to the original and gave them to my customer. The
      original ring I am now, on this seventh day of December, giving to Mr.
      Joseph Mullet, who has shown me his legitimation as a member of the Secret
      Police. I am willing to put myself at the service of the authorities if I
      am called for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are willing to do this, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Muller when the goldsmith
      had arrived at the end of the notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything to add to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is quite complete. I will sign it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several hours later, Muller re-entered the police station in his home town
      and saw the windows of the chief&rsquo;s apartment brilliantly lighted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      going on,&rdquo; he asked of Bauer&rsquo;s servant who was just hurrying up the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mistress&rsquo; birthday, we&rsquo;ve got company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller grumbled something and went on up to his own room. He knew it would
      not be pleasant for his patron to be disturbed in the midst of
      entertaining his guests, but the matter was important and could not wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective laid off his outer garments, made a few changes in his
      toilet and putting the goldsmith&rsquo;s declaration, with the ring and the
      bullet in his pocketbook, he went down to the first floor of the building,
      in one wing of which was the apartment occupied by the Chief. He sent in
      his name and was told to wait in the little study. He sat down quietly in
      a corner of the comfortable little room beyond which, in a handsomely
      furnished smoking room, a number of guests sat playing cards. From the
      drawing rooms beyond, there was the sound of music and many voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very attractive and comfortable, and the solitary man sat there
      enjoying once more the pleasant sensation of triumph, of joy at the
      victory that was his alone and that would win him back all his old friends
      and prestige. He was looking forward in agreeable anticipation to the
      explanations he had to give, when he suddenly started and grew pale. His
      eyes dimmed a moment, then he pulled himself together and murmured: &ldquo;No,
      no, not this time. I will not be weak this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the Chief entered the room, accompanied by Councillor Kniepp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down here a little?&rdquo; asked the friendly host. &ldquo;You will
      find it much quieter in this room.&rdquo; He pulled up a little table laden with
      cigars and wine, close to a comfortable armchair. Then, noticing Muller,
      he continued with a friendly nod: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they told you to wait in here.
      You must be frozen after your long ride. If you will wait just a moment
      more, I will return at once and we can go into my office. And if you will
      make yourself comfortable here, my dear Kniepp, I will send our friend
      Horn in to talk with you. He is bright and jovial and will keep you
      amused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chief chattered on, making a strenuous endeavour to appear quite
      harmless. But Kniepp, more apt than ever just now to notice the actions of
      others, saw plainly that his genial host was concealing some excitement.
      When the latter had gone out the Councillor looked after him, shaking his
      head. Then his glance fell by chance on the quiet-looking man who had
      risen at his entrance and had not sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; he said in a friendly tone, but the other did not move.
      His grey eyes gazed intently at the man whose fate he was to change so
      horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kniepp grew uneasy under the stare. &ldquo;What is there that interests you so
      about me?&rdquo; he asked in a tone that was an attempt at a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ring, the ring on your watch chain,&rdquo; murmured Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It belonged to my dead wife. I have worn it since she left me,&rdquo; answered
      the unhappy man with the same iron calm with which he had, all these past
      days, been emphasizing his love for the woman he had lost. Yet the
      question touched him unpleasantly and he looked more sharply at the
      strange man over in the corner. He saw the latter&rsquo;s face turn pale and a
      shiver run through his form. A feeling of sympathy came over Kniepp and he
      asked warmly: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take a glass of this wine? If you have been out
      in the cold it will be good for you.&rdquo; His tone was gentle, almost cordial,
      but the man to whom he offered the refreshment turned from him with a
      gesture that was almost one of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Councillor rose suddenly from his chair. &ldquo;Who are you? What news is it
      you bring?&rdquo; he asked with a voice that began to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller raised his head sharply as if his decision had been made, and his
      kind intelligent eyes grew soft as they rested on the pale face of the
      stately man before him. &ldquo;I belong to the Secret Police and I am compelled
      to find out the secrets of others&mdash;not because of my profession&mdash;no,
      because my own nature compels me&mdash;I must do it. I have just come from
      Vienna and I bring the last of the proofs necessary to turn you over to
      the courts. And yet you are a thousand times better than the coward who
      stole the honour of your wife and who hid behind the shelter of the law&mdash;and
      therefore, therefore, therefore&mdash;&rdquo; Muller&rsquo;s voice grew hoarse, then
      died away altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kniepp listened with pallid cheeks but without a quiver. Now he spoke,
      completing the other&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;And therefore you wish to save me from the
      prison or from the gallows? I thank you. What is your name?&rdquo; The unhappy
      man spoke as calmly as if the matter scarcely concerned him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective told him his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muller, Muller,&rdquo; repeated the Councillor, as if he were particularly
      anxious to remember the name. He held out his hand to the detective. &ldquo;I
      thank you, indeed, thank you,&rdquo; he said with the first sign of
      emotion he had shown, and then added low: &ldquo;Do not fear that you will have
      trouble on my account. They can find me in my home.&rdquo; With these words he
      turned away and sat down in his chair again. When Bauer entered the room a
      few moments later, Kniepp was smoking calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Muller, I&rsquo;m ready. Horn will be in in a moment, friend Kniepp; I
      know you will enjoy his chatter.&rdquo; The chief led the way out of the room
      through another door. He could not see the ghastly pale face of the guest
      he left behind him, for it was almost hidden in a cloud of thick smoke,
      but Muller turned back once more at the threshold and caught a last
      grateful glance from eyes shadowed by deep sadness, as the Councillor
      raised his hand in a friendly gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Muller, you take so long to get at the point of the story! Don&rsquo;t you
      see you are torturing me?&rdquo; This outburst came from the Chief about an hour
      later. But the detective would not permit himself to be interrupted in
      spinning out his story in his own way, and it was nearly another hour
      before Bauer knew that the man for whose name he had been waiting so long
      was Leo Kniepp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge came as a terrible surprise to him. He was dazed almost.
      &ldquo;And I,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to arrest him in my own house?&rdquo; he exclaimed as if
      horrified. And Muller answered calmly: &ldquo;I doubt if you will have the
      opportunity, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muller! Did you, again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did! I have again warned an unfortunate. It&rsquo;s my nature, I can&rsquo;t
      seem to help it. But you will find the Councillor in his house. He
      promised me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man will keep his promise,&rdquo; said Muller quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Kniepp did keep his promise. When the police arrived at the
      hunting castle shortly after midnight, they found the terrified servants
      standing by the body of their master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Muller, you had better luck than you deserved this time,&rdquo; Bauer
      said a few days later. &ldquo;This last trick has made you quite impossible for
      the service. But you needn&rsquo;t worry about that, because the legacy Kniepp
      left you will put you out of reach of want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective was as much surprised as anybody. He was as if dazed by his
      unexpected good fortune. The day before he was a poor man bowed under the
      weight of sordid cares, and now he was the possessor of twenty thousand
      gulden. And it was not his clever brain but his warm heart that had won
      this fortune for him. His breast swelled with gratitude as he thought of
      the unhappy man whose life had been ruined by the careless cruelty of
      others and his own passions. Again and again he read the letter which had
      been found on Kniepp&rsquo;s desk, addressed to him and which had been handed
      out to him after the inquest.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My friend:&mdash;

  You have saved me from the shame of an open trial.  I thank you
  for this from the very depth of my heart.  I have left you a
  part of my own private fortune, that you may be a free man, free
  as a poor man never can be.  You can accept this present for it
  comes from the hand of an honest man in spite of all.  Yes, I
  compelled my wife to go to her death after I had compelled her
  to confess her shame to me, and I entered her lover&rsquo;s house with
  the knowledge I had forced from her.  When I looked through the
  keyhole and saw his false face before me, I murdered him in cold
  blood.  Then, that the truth might not be suspected, I continued
  to play the sorrowing husband.  I wore on my watch chain the ring
  I had had made in imitation of the one my wife had worn.  This
  original ring of hers, her wedding ring which she had defiled,
  I sent in the form of a bullet straight to her lover&rsquo;s heart.
  Yes, I have committed a crime, but I feel that I am less criminal
  than those two whom I judged and condemned, and whose sentence I
  carried out as I now shall carry out my own sentence with a hand
  which will not tremble.  That I can do this myself, I have you to
  thank for, you who can look into the souls of men and recognise
  the most hidden motives, you who have not only a wonderful brain
  but a heart that can feel.  You, I hope, will sometimes think
  kindly of your grateful

  LEO KNIEPP.
</pre>
    <p>
      Muller kept this letter as one of his most sacred treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Kniepp Case&rdquo; was really, as Bauer had predicted, the last in Muller&rsquo;s
      public career. Even the friendliness of the kind old chief could not keep
      him in his position after this new display of the unreliability of his
      heart. But his quiet tastes allowed him to live in humble comfort from the
      income of his little fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every now and then letters or telegrams will come for him and he will
      disappear for several days. His few friends believe that the police
      authorities, who refused to employ him publicly owing to his strange
      weakness, cannot resist a private appeal to his talent whenever a
      particularly difficult case arises.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
